          "There are a few broad principles that we can state come out of neuroscience," says Kurt Fischer, education professor and director of the Mind, Brain, and Education Program at Harvard University. Number one? "The brain is remarkably plastic," Fischer explains. "Even in middle or old age, it's still adapting very actively to its environment." Or in other words, the brain is neuroplastic meaning that it is capable of “rewiring” in order to establish new connections between neurons. <br>
When you create new neurons, it helps you in your ability to learn new things, enhance your cognitive capabilities and even recover from strokes and traumatic brain injuries. 
Knowing that my brain is capable of developing past adulthood is reassuring. We have learned of mindful meditation and according to numerous studies, meditating regularly also assists with the malleability of the brain. This <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/assets/Harvard%20Now%20and%20Zen%20Reading%20Materials.pdf">PDF</a> from Harvard Health has many resources referring to how mindfulness helps with reshaping your brain. <br>

 Learning new skills, practicing with your non-dominant arm, practicing a new instrument increases density in grey matter and strengthens white matter. In order for neuroplastic change to take place, you need to take up a new challenge. Something new to you and not easy to learn. Have intent to learn and practice because it means something to you. Have a plan, stick to it and reward yourself for reaching milestones. <br><br>
 <a href="https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being">This</a> case study from the Univerity of Utah describes how you can use your brain to your advantage!

<h4 class="blogtitle">Mindset</h4>

<p class="blogtext">
Mindset describes how an individual will view challenges and potential setbacks. People who have a growth mindset will view challenges as an opportunity to improve their skills and that their abilities are not set in stone. It can also improve a person self esteem because they would have a more positive outlook on not achieving what was required. 
Before reading up on mindsets, I assumed that a person would either have a growth mindset or a fixed mindset. However, you can have more than one attitude towards multiple things depending on the feedback you’ve received and previous experiences. 

After studying about neuroplasticity and having a growth mindset, I feel encouraged to incorporate what I learned to my educational journey and daily life. I’ll self advocate and speak up when I am not sure about something. I’ve always struggled with asking questions but hopefully I’m still growing and learning as a person and will be better
