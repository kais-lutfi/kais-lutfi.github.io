    <h4 class="blogtitle">What did you learn about yourself?</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Even though the bootcamp hasn't and the job isn't done, it wasn't easy getting through to this stage. I learned that it's possible for 
      me to achieve what I need to with hard work and determination. I'm also aware that I need to try to improve my emotional intelligence
      to acheive better things in my career and life.  
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Role of Values, Empathy, and Self-awareness</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Those characteristics are important regardless of where you are in the journey of life. In terms of learning and becoming a programmer, 
       it is those traits that will guide you and help make you a better person.
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">What surprised me?</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Neuroplasticity and the growth mindset. It is fascinating to think that you can still mend your brain for the better.
      </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Challenges</h4>
    <p class="blogtext"> The most challenging part for me was trying to regularly meditate. I managed to do sometimes and I always 
      felt like a better human being afterwards. I'll try to do it as much as I can!
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Why core learning?</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Other than helping us becoming better humans, help us become better student, better future employees!
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Waste of time?</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">Not at all! I enjoy those parts and its always calming reflecting back and having deep thoughts. We need to be good
      people to achieve good things afterall!
