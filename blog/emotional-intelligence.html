    <p class="blogtext"> Emotional intelligence or EQ is one’s ability to manage their own emotions in a way that helps you to manage stress, being overwhelmed, and empathize with others. When you are being emotional, you can sometimes take “the wrong decision” because you haven’t taken the time to examine and analyze how you feel and why you feel that way. Being self aware also means you know your strengths and weaknesses and you can act accordingly. This will improve your relationship with yourself and others. 

      While IQ is meant to measure a person intelligence ability through logic tests, EQ is a measure of a person understanding their own emotions and what ties to it. According to numerous studies, EQ is just as important if not more in order to have a successful career.
