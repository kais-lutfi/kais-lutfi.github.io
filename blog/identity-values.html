    <h4 class="blogtitle"> My personal core values </h4>

    <p class="blogtext">Having my family around me definitely brings me strength and I certainly value that. For a long time, some of my family members were on the other side of the world. Technology did help a little, but also it made me appreciate how much I’ve missed them and how much I relied on their love and support. It took so much work and effort at the end of the day to bring us all together and it was all worth it.  

Peace and harmony is also some I value, whether it’s in the workplace or just out on the streets. I feel like I function better as a person when I’m at ease. Coming from a country that’s been wartorn for decades had me a appreciate living in a society where I feel safe and comfortable.

<h4 class="blogtitle">Ethical Situation</h4>
<p class="blogtext">During my time as a bar manager, I was frequently pressured by bar owners to sell as much as possible. While it is my duty to do the best for the business I work for, it was also my duty to keep a safe environment for the customers and the rest of the team. It was tricky trying to keep a balance but some things are more important more than money. </p>

<p class="blogtext">I come for a cultural that’s taught me to appreciate knowledge, how to be kind, and how to love one another. My late grandfather had travelled to England to get his masters which was unknown for at the time where he lived. He came back with an accent which we all found amusing. 

<h4 class="blogtitle">Strength and Limitations</h4>

<p class="blogtext">Honesty: Being honest while working in a team is vital helping in curbing  conflict. In the past, I’ve tried to be as honest as when I have felt that something should’ve been done better. </p>
 
  <p class="blogtext">Limitations: Shyness is a big one for me. I find it hard to ask for help and always assume I can figure it out by myself and then find myself in the famous rabbit-hole.</p>

<h4 class="blogtitle">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4>

<p class="blogtext">Working on a project when your team members aren’t fully committed to the cause can be a bit challenging. While designing a UAV for my final project in university, I had an honest conversation with one of my team members because I felt they were not applying their full potential. With a bit of compromise from all parties, we managed to get that thing flying! </p>
