      <h4 class="blogtitle">Stuck on a problem</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Numerous times during this sprint I got stuck. It was frustrating and I questioned myself 
      and my intellectual abilities, however, with enough perseverence, I did end up finding a solution
      for most those problems. <br>
      The last  katas were frustrating in particular, "finding Scooby" and "deBee". I kept getting unexpected
      errors and having to go back and change the code when I need to. I googled, and searched on discord and found
      a few answers, but I didn't want to input them until I feel I understood them enough.  <br>
      Obviously running into a hurdle and then finding a solution is a nice feeling and rewarding when 
      you confirm that you got the correct result. I still have a lot to go through though! <br>
      What I learned is no matter how big the problem is, if you break it down, understand it in the way it's meant
      to be understood, it'll be a lot easier than you think. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Good Problem solving</h4>
    <p class="blogtext"> I think the gradebook kata was the one I moved on from quickly and smoothly, it 
      clicked right away. I pseudo-coded, figured out what I needed to do and went to google. Quickly, 
      I found a way to add all numbers in an array, and another way to divide it but array.length! 
      </p>
      <h4 class="blogtitle">Reflecting on problem solving techniques</h4>
      <p class="blogtext">
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          <p class="blogtext"> When I pseudocode, I feel like I'm already breaking down a problem 
            to smaller chunks that I can manage. It also helps following the steps that you wrote down
            and follow it with code that the computer can read. 
          </p>
          <li>Trying something</li>
          <p class="blogtext">
            I always did that for better or worse, I could always work back or carry on from that point.
          </p>
          <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
          <p class="blogtext">
            I've been speaking to myself in random places like the shower, I don't think it's worked
            as well as I'd have hoped so far but I know it works. Will keep on practicing talking to
            my "rubber ducky".
          </p>
          <li>Console.logging</li>
          <p class="blogtext">
            Not doing it as much as I should. I am very aware that it could save you a huge amount of time
            if you spot an issue right away. Will try to make it a habit.
          </p>
          <li>Googling</li>
          <p class="blogtext">
            Google has definitely been a good friend of mine, always my first destination. A lot of website
            let you run the code on the page itself which is quickly becoming a favorite feature. 
          </p>
          <li>Asking your peers/coaches for help</li>
          <p class="blogtext">
            Other than using the search function on discord, I haven't asked anyone for help. I know I should,
             and there is no shame in asking "dumb" questions. I guess on some level, I worry that what I would be asking
             is not advanced enough.
          </p>

          <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
          <p class="blogtext"> Strive to improve everyday! Learning more, meditating, reflecting on what you're doing well 
            and do more of it I guess.
