    <h4 class="blogtitle">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
<p class="blogtext">Becoming a software developer will open so many opportunities up! An idea I flirted with in the past is using my knowledge as an aerospace engineer and combine this with the skills I’m learning today.</p>
<h4 class="blogtitle">A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h4>
<p class="blogtext">Problem solving skills would be a strength. I try to rephrase the question and find multiple avenues in order to solve the problem at hand. I’ve already run into multiple problems and a bit of research and tenacity had helped me out. </p>
<p class="blogtext">Being distracted or managing my time effectively; sometimes I feel like I get stuck for far too long on a simple problem that could’ve been solved with one line of code. </p>
<h4 class="blogtitle">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
<p class="blogtext">Work on being less shy; not afraid to ask questions when I’m feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<h4 class="blogtitle">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
<p class="blogtext">I have the skills required to work in harmony with others. I have already figured out that I’m more productive in a learning environment rather than at home so I’ve been frequenting the library more often. </p>
<h4 class="blogtitle">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>
<p class="blogtext">I have support from my family and partner. They’ve been keeping me sane and well!</p>
<h4 class="blogtitle">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
<p class="blogtext">Plenty of resources online, I’ve used w3school heaps so far, the discord channel always is helpful too!</p>
<h4 class="blogtitle">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
<p class="blogtext">Technical support when needed.</p>
<h4 class="blogtitle">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
<p class="blogtext">My last day of work will be this Friday (26/4) so hopefully I’ll have more time to learn and practice code. Other than that and the odd babysitting emergency, my schedule is pretty free.</p>
