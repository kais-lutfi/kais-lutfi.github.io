      Javascript in relationship to HTML & CSS
    </h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Javascript assists a webpage in order to perform actions. 
      If we think of a webpage as a fully functioning aircraft, HTML would be the body of an aircraft.
      Just like a webpage, within the body,
      you would have different sections, like the fuselage, wings, rudders and cockpit. CSS would specify the 
      size of each of those sections, the colour of the fuselage, the logo on the tail of an aircraft.
      How it all comes together is Javascript, or an Aircraft's flight control system, it would use the different sections of the body 
      to manipulate the aircraft to acheive a smooth flying experience.

      Control flow & Loops
    </h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
    Control flow tells your computer in which order to run code. In your script
    you can specify what a certain function will lead to, or if function is absent, how to respond.
    Let's assume it's time for lunch. You head to the kitchen and look for food to prepare. "if" you
    have food, you can make lunch. "else", you need to head to the supermarket and purchase some groceries.
    However, it's the next day and it's time for lunch again, you can "Loop" the same process again until you have
    satisfied certain conditions, i.e. had lunch!

    <h4 class="blogtitle">What is the DOM?</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Document Object Model or DOM for short is an interface that lets Javascript
      interact with HTML. When using the DOM, you can modify elements without interfering with
      the hardcoded HTML. This allows a user to have a customized experience with a 
      webpage depending on how it was manipulated. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Objects & Arrays</h4>
    <p class="blogtext"> Objects and arrays are two different methods of collecting data into
      a group. With objects, data can be accessed by using keys. Keys can be strings, numbers, or even 
      arrays. Arrays, just like objects, store information, however, you access the information 
      by using numberical index.<br> In other words, if you need to access data where
      the sequence of the data is necessary, use arrays, otherwise use objects.
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Javascript Functions</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
    Javascript functions are simply a set of instructions (code) that enables you
    to use at any given time. In order to run a function, you need to "call" it by using "()"
    </p>
