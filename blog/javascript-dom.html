      Javascript in relationship to HTML & CSS
    </h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Javascript assists a webpage in order to perform actions. 
      If we think of a webpage as a fully functioning aircraft, HTML would be the body of an aircraft.
      Just like a webpage, within the body,
      you would have different sections, like the fuselage, wings, rudders and cockpit. CSS would specify the 
      size of each of those sections, the colour of the fuselage, the logo on the tail of an aircraft.
      How it all comes together is Javascript, or an Aircraft's flight control system, it would use the different sections of the body 
      to manipulate the aircraft to acheive a smooth flying experience.

      Control flow & Loops
    </h4>
    <p class= "blogtext">
    Control flow tells your computer in which order to run code. In your script
    you can specify what a certain function will lead to, or if function is absent, how to respond.
    Let's assume it's time for lunch. You head to the kitchen and look for food to prepare. "if" you
    have food, you can make lunch. "else", you need to head to the supermarket and purchase some groceries.
    However, it's the next day and it's time for lunch again, you can "Loop" the same process again until you have
    satisfied certain conditions, i.e. had lunch!  <br>  <br>
    A "for loop" statement consists of three different expressions seperated by a semicolon. An initializer, a condition and an iterator.
    <img id="blogimg" src=" ../loop ex + exp result.png"> The initializer, represented by "i=0" in the example above, is where you want your first
    loop to start from. The condition, "i < 4" in the example, is checked everytime the loop is run until the condition is not met. The iterator, is a expression thats excecuted after
    every loop. The iteration can be changed to descending order as well with "i--".

    <h4 class="blogtitle">What is the DOM?</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
      Document Object Model or DOM for short is an interface that lets Javascript
      interact with HTML. When using the DOM, you can modify elements without interfering with
      the hardcoded HTML. This allows a user to have a customized experience with a 
      webpage depending on how it was manipulated. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Objects & Arrays</h4>
    <p class="blogtext"> Objects and arrays are two different methods of collecting data into
      a group. Data in an array is stored in an orderly fashion, the first element within an array is stored at index 0. You can do different
       things to an array, like adding to the list (using push/splice), removing elements (using pop/shift/splice).
       <br>
       With objects, data gets stored as properties that are made up of keys and values. To access data in an object you can either use a 
       dot or a bracket notation.
       <img id="blogimg" src=" ../object example.png">
       As seen in the image above, you can use arrays as values if needed!
    </p>
    <h4 class="blogtitle">Javascript Functions</h4>
    <p class="blogtext">
    Javascript functions are simply a set of instructions (code) that enables you
    to use at any given time. In order to run a function, you need to "call" it by using "()". Below is an example of how you can use a Javascript 
    function. <img id="blogimg" src=" ../function example.png">
    We used function "toUSD" to convert NZD to USD. You can always input a different argument and it will be multiplied by 0.64.
    </p>
